Synopsis
--------

Manage the storage network configuration on the HPE Nimble Storage group.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- Ansible 2.9 or later
- NimbleOS 5.0 or later
- HPE Nimble Storage SDK for Python 1.0.0 or later (nimble-sdk Python module)



Parameters
----------

  activate (False, bool, None)
    Activate a network configuration.


  array (False, list, None)
    List of array network configs.


  change_name (False, str, None)
    Change name of the existing network config.


  iscsi_automatic_connection_method (False, bool, None)
    Whether automatic connection method is enabled. Enabling this means means redirecting connections from the specified iSCSI discovery IP address to the best data IP address based on connection counts.


  iscsi_connection_rebalancing (False, bool, None)
    Whether rebalancing is enabled. Enabling this means rebalancing iSCSI connections by periodically breaking existing connections that are out-of-balance, allowing the host to reconnect to a more appropriate data IP address.


  ignore_validation_mask (False, int, None)
    Indicates whether to ignore the validation.


  mgmt_ip (False, str, None)
    Management IP address for the Group. Four numbers in the range (0,255) separated by periods.


  name (True, str, None)
    Name of the network configuration. Use the name 'draft' when creating a draft configuration.


  secondary_mgmt_ip (False, str, None)
    Secondary management IP address for the Group. Four numbers in the range [0,255] separated by periods.


  subnet (False, list, None)
    List of subnet configs.


  route (False, list, None)
    List of static routes.


  state (True, str, None)
    The network config operation.


  validate (False, bool, None)
    Validate a network configuration.


  host (True, str, None)
    HPE Nimble Storage IP address.


  password (True, str, None)
    HPE Nimble Storage password.


  username (True, str, None)
    HPE Nimble Storage user name.
