- HPE Nimble Storage arrays running NimbleOS 5.0 or later

- Python >=v3.6

## Installation

Install the HPE Nimble Storage array collection on your Ansible management host.

- Download the collection.
- Go to the downloaded path and run cmd " ansible-galaxy collection install <package-name.tar.gz>". Ex: ansible-galaxy collection install hpe-nimble-1.0.0.tar.gz.
